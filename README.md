# Letter Getter

Letter getter is a web-based anagram game based in large part
off of Bookworm Adventures, the 2006 game by PopCap.


# How to Play

Spell the largest word you can find from the 4x4 grid of tiles.
Each tile may only be used once, but tiles with the same letters
can be used however many times the tile appears. Either click or
type to input letters for submissions. You can submit as many
times you would like for any given board.

# Scoring

Score is awarded based primarily on the length of the word,
with more points being given for harder-to-use letters and
harder-to-use sequences of letters. There is almost always
at least one 100+ score word in each rack.

(although it may not be easy to find...)
